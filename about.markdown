I'm sharing some projects and ideas here as well as anything I find fun.

You'll find all sorts of cool things here: stuff related to math, computers, programming, books, drawing, monkeys, maps, chemistry, calendars. That's not at all exhaustive, but I hope it gives you an idea of what this site is about.

Also, poltomo is just a made up word I came up with.
