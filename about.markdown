I will write editorials to some of the competitive programming problems I solve. The problems I do are usually from cses.fi, and codeforces. This way, I will remember the solution better.

My name is Varun. I study computer science at UCI. I also interned at Intel for some time. Most recently, I interned at Amazon.
