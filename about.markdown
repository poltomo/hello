# updates

September 8, 2023  
I will write editorials to various competitive programming problems that I find cool. The problems I do are usually from cses.fi, HackerRank assessments, and codeforces.

Since I want to increase the pace I solve problems, I cannot write about every problem, so I will just write quick editorials after contests. My goal with writing a short editorial is to make sure the intuition behind a problem sticks for longer. Now, I primarily do problems from codeforces, atcoder, cses.fi, and HackerRank tests.

On top of problem editorials, I now post updates on projects and ideas I have.

Now I am seriously trying to push my codeforces rank.  
This is me on codeforces: [thejamba](https://codeforces.com/profile/thejamba)  
Here's a little about me:  
my name is Varun. I study computer science at UCI. I also interned at Intel for some time.

The name of the site changed from my github username to "project by varun". I am not doing all that well in codeforces contests, and I need to find more time to upsolve problems.  
  
I am taking [Scientific Computing](https://ics.uci.edu/~xhx/courses/CS206/), [Efficient ML Computing](https://sites.google.com/uci.edu/tomyeh/cs-190295-efficient-ml-comp), and graphical models.
I'm going to try do some past kaggle and atcoder heuristic contests.

At LA Hacks, I stayed up all night making this vector search thing aided by image encodings. This is not how good work is done. I passed out during the awards ceremony. The same thing happened last time, except last year I made a lame project. At least this time, the Intel sponsor people shouted out my project.

I just now received a very exciting email. I will tell more later.

No more posts until October, 2024. I will have something special completed by then.
