I will write editorials to various competitive programming problems that I find cool. The problems I do are usually from cses.fi, HackerRank assessments, and leetcode.

Since I want to increase the pace I solve problems, I cannot write about every problem, so I will just write quick editorials after contests. My goal with writing a short editorial is to make sure the intuition behind a problem sticks for longer. Now, I primarily do problems from codeforces, atcoder, cses.fi, and HackerRank tests.

On top of problem editorials, I now post updates on projects and ideas I have.
