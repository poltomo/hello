I've been doing competitive programming for quite a while now, so I'll be writing editorials here about problems I find cool.

In time though, you'll find all sorts of neat things here: stuff related to math, computers, programming, books, drawing, monkeys, maps, chemistry, calendars. That's not at all exhaustive, but I hope it gives you an idea of what this site is about.

Also, poltomo is just a made up word I came up with.
