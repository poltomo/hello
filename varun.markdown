# Other

I've worked as an undergraduate researcher for a research proposal at UCI. It was quite fun.

Also, this April, I attended LA Hacks. Lots of big companies showed up. There was this company that makes drones for warzones. There was also this LLM company, Cohere. that came.

I started a blog which you can find on this site as well as a [youtube channel][https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYyaD89QqfCwwZ-RYG0W8aQ].


I read some books towards the end of last year and this year:

Land of the Silent People	about a news reporter who covers WW2 during Eastern Europe
For Whom The Bell Tolls		Man blows up bridge
Catcher in The Rye		fun fact: the guy who shot John Lennon loved this book. What a fool.
Cannery Row			this book is alright
