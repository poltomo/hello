## Other

I've worked as an undergraduate researcher for a research proposal at UCI. It was quite fun.

Also, this April, I attended LA Hacks. There was this company that makes drones for warzones, which is pretty neat.

I started a blog which you can find on this site as well as a [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYyaD89QqfCwwZ-RYG0W8aQ).
