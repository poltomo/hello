Here's some cool things I've learned.

# Horner's Rule

Horner's Rule is a good way to compute a polynomial expression

F = a0 * x^0 + a1 * x^1 + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n
F is an nth degree polynomial

F = ( ( (an * x) + an-1) * x) + an-2) * x ...

{% highlight python %}
def Horner(A, x : int) -> int:
    ans = 0
    for a in A[::-1]:
        ans = (ans + a) * x

    return ans{% endhighlight %}
{% endhighlight %}
