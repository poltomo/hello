# Horner's Rule
F = a0 * x^0 + a1 * x^1 + a2 * x^2 + ... + an * x^n
F is an nth degree polynomial

F = ( ( (an * x) + an-1) * x) + an-2) * x ...

```python
# A is an array of coefficients
def Horner(A, x : int) -> int:
    ans = 0
    for a in A[::-1]:
        ans = (ans + a) * x

    return ans
```
