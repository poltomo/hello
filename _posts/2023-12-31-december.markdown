Today is the last day of 2023. It is about 8 o'clock in the morning and I forgot to sleep. That is why my new year's resolution is to sleep before midnight everyday. Anyways, I will sleep now, and finish this post before the end of the year.

# making rubbish text with word-level Markov chains


Quick aside, this simplifies the -I and -L flags for compiling programs that include glib. I installed glib with homebrew, and gcc wouldn't recognize the glib.h header for some reason, so I had to do this.

```
gcc-13 <program-that-includes-glib> $(pkg-config --cflags --libs glib-2.0)
```
