# November 20 Update

I am working on an important project but its taking me some time.  

I will still put out some cses solutions. There's also this years' facebook hacker cup questions.

My main priorities are:
1. complete my project  
2. glean an enormous amount of knowledge. I've come across a lot of good readings and books
[favorite number theory blog](https://exploringnumbertheory.wordpress.com), advanced computer architecture: a qualitative approach, information retrieval book, information theory and inference McKay, Mathematics for Machine Learning, [favorite GPU programmer](https://leimao.github.io), nervana systems guides and papers, colfax research whitepapers, ...

3. reach expert level in codeforces before 2024 is over (post solutions on the way)  

I will make sure to keep posting things, like problem solutions among other things.

Miscellaneous posts to expect:  
Finding all Wholefoods, Amazon Fresh, and Waitrose locations in London  
London to Edinburgh on foot
