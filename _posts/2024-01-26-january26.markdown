Building anything that is more than a couple of files of code on my mac has been really annoying and tedious.
I have a compact pc for these cases, but I do not have a monitor for it. Now I just use a docker container.


Create this docker compose file in a folder:
~/myfolder/docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  dev:
    image: arm64v8/ubuntu
    platform: linux/arm64
    volumes:
      - .:/root/myfolder
    working_dir: /root
    network_mode: host
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```



In the same directory as my docker-compose.yml (~/myfolder/):
```
docker compose run --name=mycontainer dev bash
```

Then make the mounted folder writable:
```
sudo chmod +w ~/myfolder
```

In the container:
```
apt update
apt install build-essentials vim
```

Now I can just build things and run in the container or cross compile for the host machine.


Useful commands:
```
# start the container when the docker daemon is running
docker start -i mycontainer

# stop the container
docker stop mycontainer

# opens a bash container in the running container
docker exec -it mycontainer bash

# remove all stopped containers
docker container prune
```
