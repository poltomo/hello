Building anything that is more than a couple of files of code on my mac has been really annoying and tedious.
I have a compact pc for these cases, but I do not have a monitor for it. Now I just use a docker container.


docker-compose.yml
```yml
version: "3"
services:
  dev:
    image: arm64v8/ubuntu
    platform: linux/arm64
    volumes:
      - .:/root/myfolder
    working_dir: /root
    network_mode: host
    security_opt:
      - seccomp:unconfined
    cap_add:
      - SYS_PTRACE
```

```
docker compose run --name=mycontainer dev bash
```

In the container now:
```
apt update
apt install build-essentials vim glpk
```
